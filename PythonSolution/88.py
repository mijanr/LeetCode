Problem Description: 
    You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, 
    representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
    Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
    The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. 
    To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, 
    and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
